# Readme

This repository provides data and code to reproduce the figures of **"Contrasting state-dependent effects of natural forcing on global and local climate variability"** (Ellerhoff et al., 2022) published in *Geophysical Research Letters*: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022GL098335. The presented code is released under the Zenodo identifier https://zenodo.org/record/6474769.

**Responsibility for this repository:** Beatrice Ellerhoff ([@bellerhoff](https://github.com/bellerhoff)) and Kira Rehfeld ([@krehfeld](https://github.com/krehfeld)). The code builds on previous analysis by Moritz J. Kirschner ([@cellador](https://github.com/cellador)). Elisa Ziegler ([@elisaziegler](https://github.com/elisaziegler)) helped to conduct the TransEBM simulations and their analysis (https://github.com/paleovar/TransEBM).

Please see `./license.md` for terms of use. This repository contains the **maintained code and processed data** to create the figures of *Ellerhoff et al. (2022)*. The model simulation data can be found on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6074747) under the identifier 10.5281/zenodo.6074747 . 

## Organisation of this repository

The repository contains scripts (e.g., `F2.R`), input data (`./data`), and additional information (e.g., `license.md`). It is organized in a folder structure, where each folder comprises a specific analysis. To reproduce a figure from *Ellerhoff et al. (2022)* run the script that is named as the figure (Figure `X` of the main manuscript is denoted by `FX.R` and Figure `X` of the supplementary materials is denoted by `FSX.R`). The main directory contains  scripts (`.R`-files) and files that define useful functions and plotting parameters.

`F1.R`- `F4.R` | Scripts to reproduce the figures of the **main manuscript**.
`FS1.R`- `FS11.R`| Scripts to reproduce the figures of the **supplemental information**.

## Prerequisites

Our code requires the following [R](https://www.r-project.org/) packages:

- `stats`
- `utils`
- `polyclip` (might additionally require [`Rtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/))
- `ncdf4`
- `RColorBrewer`
- `maps` (can be obtained from https://github.com/krehfeld/nest, using `devtools::install_github()`)
- `PaleoSpec` (can be obtained from https://github.com/EarthSystemDiagnostics/paleospec, using `devtools::install_github()`)

Creating some of the figures additionally requires (separately loaded in the corresponding `.R` scripts):

- `dplyr`
- `openxlsx`

Generating the input data once the raw data is available on Zenodo (after publication) additionally requires:

- `ncdf4`
- `boot`
- `parallel`
- `graphics`
